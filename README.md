# Python-Final-Project
CTY Python Final Project

For this Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth Course (Introduction to Python Programming for Middle School Students), I was instructed to create an online shopping cart program for a bookstore. The program has 5 main functions:

1. Display a list of books available for sale
2. Buy a book from the list by adding the book to the user's virtual shopping cart
3. Show items in the cart
4. Checkout - Shows the user which books are in their cart and how much the total cost is
5. Quit the Program
